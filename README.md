## Info

Not a lot of information exists online about this machine, so I'm hoping to document what I've uncovered in one spot.

There's a [manual](./ELGIN2468InstructionBooklet.pdf) committed inside of this repo which also contains threading + oiling info.

## Presser feet

Machine is high-shank left homing needle position. Tough to find presser feet for these.

5561 (narrow hemming) 
  - [example listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/191943009426)

5557 (straight stitch narrow):
  - [unknown if this seller works] [listing 1](https://www.sewingpartsonline.com/straight-stitch-foot-high-left-narrow-5557.aspx)
  - [never shipped] [listing 2](https://ultimatesewingandvac.com/product/foot-straight-stitch-high-left-position-narrow/)
  - [worked] [listing 3](https://www.seweasysewing.com/shop/c/p/Straight-Stitch-Foot-High-Left-Narrow-5557-x23638148.htm)

### Wide high shank straight stitch left position presser foot

Based on [this listing](https://thesilkpincushionboutique.com/product/singer-sewing-machine-1-4-high-shank-straight-stitch-left-position-foot-wide-bp1819/#)
, I managed to get a successful working order in.

BP1819 or 55621 is the part number. 
  - Outer bag was branded "Brewer Quilting and Sewing", "Reorder number #BP1819". 
  - Inside the bag was labeled "55621". 
  - Both probably work, but not sure of a reliable source to get them yet.

Also tried [ultimatesewingandvac.com](https://ultimatesewingandvac.com/product/foot-straight-stitch-high-shank-left-position-wide/)
but they never shipped my order out.

Similar feet:
  - 55605/BP1818 is wide, low shank foot (could use adapter)
  - 55688H is high shank, center position

### Kenmore feet

Do Kenmore feet work here? Seems like a lot were left basis. Ordered a set of hemming feet to find out.
Turns out no -- they are super high shank, imcompatible. Listing was wrong.

Searching for a "high shank hemming foot kit" doesn't yield anything compatible. It seems hemming feet
only ever came in kits for super high or low shank machines. Guess it's back to the iron for me...

## Bobbin winder

There's a rubber tire that mounts on this. To reorder for my machine, the following search worked:

"Bobbin Winder Rubber Tire Ring - Standard #15287"

There's a lot of options here, so search and find whatever works for you.

## Cams

I got lucky and found an ebay auction in short time for them.

For those not as lucky as me, you should be able to look for a set that looks like this photo:

### 3D printing a cam to make the machine center homing

This is an idea I saw floating somewhere in a Facebook group.

I haven't had the need/time to take this up, but this could be a very interesting project.
