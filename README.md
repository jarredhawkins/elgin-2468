## presser feet

Machine is high-shank left homing needle position. Tough to find presser feet for these.

5561 (narrow hemming) [example listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/191943009426)

5557 (straight stitch narrow):

### Wide high shank straight stitch left position presser foot

BP1819 or 55621 seems to be the part number, can't find much online. Ordered both of these and will update:

55605/BP1818 is wide, low shank foot (could use adapter)
55688H is high shank, center position

TBD: do Kenmore feet work here? Seems like a lot were left basis. Ordered a set of hemming feet to find out.
A: no -- they are super high shank, imcompatible.
